In absence of a better idea of splitting things up, I'll use this as a general brain and idea dump for everything and nothing.

### About this blog, the weather, me and the meaning of life

So what you can and will find here is stuff that I personally considered interesting, thought provoking, funny, smart or otherwise worthwhile posting - which probably involves techy and nerdy topics, as well as philosophical discussions, general scientific considerations, languages, music, arts, learning and absurdities.

Some things I definitively plan to write about: Free, Libre and Open-Source Projects, Operating Systems and the Usage of Computers in General, Programming Languages, -Paradigms and -Concepts (and how all that stuff relates to the industry), Sentient Machines and the Future of Humanity, Insights from a Modern (digital & non-digital) Life, and How to Get Along With People...

### So, who am I?

_(No, this is not the meaning of life part yet, hang tight)_

I consider myself an all-time student of everything...

Well, more seriously, I spend most of my time either working on software projects for clients - I'm a self-acclaimed expert in all things Scala/JVM and backend API related - or with my colleagues from [INNOKI](http://innoki.de) where we facilitate innovative workmodes in big and small teams and enterprises.

Apart from that, my other aspirations go more into the direction of research and science: Personally, I find it far more rewarding and motivating to get to know and understand the world, compared to earning, managing and spending money - as most of my fellow humans seem to enjoy these days.

### Alright, but what about the weather and that meaning of life thingy?

I also like rhetoric questions and weird humor.
