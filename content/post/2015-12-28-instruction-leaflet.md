What this blog is about, who I am, about the weather and the answer to the meaning of life.

<!--more-->

### So you're here.

In absence of a better method of publishing thoughts for eternity (or however long GitHub might exist), I'll use this website as a general brain and idea dump for everything and nothing.

So what you can and will find here, is stuff that I personally considered interesting, thought provoking, funny, smart or otherwise worthwhile posting - which probably involves techy and nerdy topics, as well as philosophical discussions, general scientific considerations, languages, music, arts, learning and absurdities.

Some things I definitively plan to write about: _Free, Libre and Open-Source Projects_, _Operating Systems_ and the _Usage of Computers in General_, _Programming Languages, -Paradigms and -Concepts_ (and how all that stuff relates to the industry), _Sentient Machines and the Future of Humanity_, _Insights from a Modern_ (digital & non-digital) _Life_, and _How to Get Along With People_...

### Alright, so, who am I?

_(This is not the meaning of life part yet, hang tight)_

I consider myself an all-time student of everything - naturally curious!

Well, more seriously, I spend most of my time either working on software projects - I'm an entrepreneur and freelance software-architect, nerd, functional-language evangelist, and web-backend expert.
I also helped building [INNOKI](http://innoki.de) where we facilitate innovative and empathetic workmodes in big and small teams and enterprises. (As empty and buzz-wordy as it might sound, it actually works)

Apart from that, my other passion is everything science!
I love learning and understanding, even if the world seems organized in ways that are hostile to doing that in full creative freedom.
Fields of interest there reach from political, social, and educational over languages, design and music, to practically everything in natural sciences, maths, engineering and computer science.

### And what about the weather and that meaning of life thingy?

I also like rhetoric questions and weird humor.
