&lt;p&gt;In absence of a better idea of splitting things up, I&amp;rsquo;ll use this as a general brain and idea dump for everything and nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-this-blog-the-weather-me-and-the-meaning-of-life:12775062aa95f53d4ae64b8b5b9a7e91&#34;&gt;About this blog, the weather, me and the meaning of life&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what you can and will find here is stuff that I personally considered interesting, thought provoking, funny, smart or otherwise worthwhile posting - which probably involves techy and nerdy topics, as well as philosophical discussions, general scientific considerations, languages, music, arts, learning and absurdities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things I definitively plan to write about: Free, Libre and Open-Source Projects, Operating Systems and the Usage of Computers in General, Programming Languages, -Paradigms and -Concepts (and how all that stuff relates to the industry), Sentient Machines and the Future of Humanity, Insights from a Modern (digital &amp;amp; non-digital) Life, and How to Get Along With People&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-who-am-i:12775062aa95f53d4ae64b8b5b9a7e91&#34;&gt;So, who am I?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(No, this is not the meaning of life part yet, hang tight)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider myself an all-time student of everything&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, more seriously, I spend most of my time either working on software projects for clients - I&amp;rsquo;m a self-acclaimed expert in all things Scala/JVM and backend API related - or with my colleagues from &lt;a href=&#34;http://innoki.de&#34;&gt;INNOKI&lt;/a&gt; where we facilitate innovative workmodes in big and small teams and enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, my other aspirations go more into the direction of research and science: Personally, I find it far more rewarding and motivating to get to know and understand the world, compared to earning, managing and spending money - as most of my fellow humans seem to enjoy these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;alright-but-what-about-the-weather-and-that-meaning-of-life-thingy:12775062aa95f53d4ae64b8b5b9a7e91&#34;&gt;Alright, but what about the weather and that meaning of life thingy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like rhetoric questions and weird humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Johanna&lt;/p&gt;
