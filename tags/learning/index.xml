&lt;p&gt;The process of learning new things is usually thought of as painful by most people (remember school?). However, I&amp;rsquo;m obsessed with aquiring knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m actually not sure if the term holistic learning was coined there, but I first came across it in an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2007/03/25/how-to-ace-your-finals-without-studying/&#34;&gt;article by Scott H. Young&lt;/a&gt;. He describes a mindset of constant learning, independant of the actual subject or topic, for the sake of making more and more connections between single pieces of information. According to him, knowledge is only &amp;lsquo;hard&amp;rsquo; to get, when you try to learn topics by heart without seeing their relation to other concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea is fascinating to me, because I realized that most of my motivation stems from learning and understanding things about the world and not so much from materialistic gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-reality-check:a76faf23897e2fefd090c4feab77649c&#34;&gt;The reality check&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice I noticed that when I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m doing pastime things - watching series, reading books, listening to music etc. - I could just as well use the same time to learn. The motivation for these activities is usually to relax and free my mind from everyday-life activities. So I normally don&amp;rsquo;t really want to put some more extra effort on top of that and fry my brain while studying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to this dilemma lies, in my opinion, in finding a way to combine both parts, i.e. making the pastime activity a pastime+learning activity. If I&amp;rsquo;m reading books I&amp;rsquo;m reading them in a language I want to practise. If I&amp;rsquo;m watching series I watch them in their original language - or replace them with documentaries, lectures and other video content with an emphasis on information. (Lectures and talks can in fact be very entertaining, if you find a person who is eloquent and smart)&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m also trying to spice up my freetime with a little bit of brainwork that is very different from what I normally do, for example exercises in maths and physics. This works surprisingly well - I assume that the nature of these tasks are so far off from my normal mental routines that it acts as a distraction just as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I used to do the same thing with software projects - they were the distraction from my everyday life at university. But ever since I started working with code in a commercial environment, I find it harder and harder to continue with hacking in my freetime as well. It&amp;rsquo;s especially sad since the software I work with professionally is usually much less experimental and thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum this up, in my opinion the idea of learning has been diluted by so many negative aspects that it&amp;rsquo;s very uncommon to find people who have a strong motivation for it on their own. But there are certainly ways to embrace it and continue with self-education on an everyday basis with it not being a chore but a pleasure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Maybe it makes sense to collect a few thought provoking pastime+learning concepts, so I&amp;rsquo;ll put them here whenever I happen to come across one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
